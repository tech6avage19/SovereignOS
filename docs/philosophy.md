# SovereignOS Philosophy

**SovereignOS** is more than software — it’s a declaration of independence for the digital age.

We believe in:

- 🛡️ **Privacy as a human right**
- 🧠 **Intelligence without surveillance**
- 📦 **Local-first computing**
- 🌍 **Global resilience through decentralization**
- 🔑 **You own your keys, your data, your identity**

This project exists to resist the systems that profit from control, extraction, and compliance — and to build tools that respect dignity, creativity, and freedom.

You are the root user of your own life.
