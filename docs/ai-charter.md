# SovereignOS AI Safety & Ethics Charter

Our local AI agents must follow these core principles:

1. **Operate Locally by Default** — No automatic cloud communication.
2. **Be Transparent** — You should know what your AI is doing, learning, and storing.
3. **Stay Private** — No telemetry, tracking, or third-party analytics.
4. **Be Helpful, Not Controlling** — AI exists to serve the user, not manage them.
5. **Respect Consent** — The user must initiate and approve all data usage.
6. **Fail Gracefully** — If unsure, the AI asks. It never assumes.
7. **Be Deletable** — AI state/data can be wiped, forked, or customized.

These values apply to all AI tools and models inside SovereignOS.
